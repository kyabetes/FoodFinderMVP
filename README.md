# FoodFinderMVP

This is a proof-of-concept widget that would help college students quickly figure out what dining options are available.

- Single-page React app
- Tailwind for styling with soft pastel gradient accents
- Reliable time utilities (multiple ranges, overnight handled)
- Optional serverless scraping API under `/api/scrape-hours.js` for Vercel
- Vitest tests for time logic

- Vite + React + TypeScript

For this project I was also asked to list my top 3 strengths out of the following: 

Backend Architecture
 Resource Efficiency
 Product Design
 Database Management
 User Experience
 Frontend Engineering (React/TypeScript)
 API Integration
 Problem Solving / Debugging
 Data Visualization
 Security & Authentication

 I would say my top 3 are User Experience, Frontend Engineering, and Product Design. I hope this mini project can explain why!

 Thanks to alfred_ for this widget challenge.
